# job application form

this is a job application form i made as my third project this month. i'm 13 and still learning web development, so this was a fun challenge for me.

## how i built this

started with a simplilearn html tutorial from their "introduction to html" course, but then i got carried away and added a bunch of my own stuff. the basic form structure came from the tutorial, but everything else is me figuring things out.

## what it does

- collects job application info (names, email, resume upload, etc)
- works on mobile phones too
- has some basic javascript validation
- looks pretty decent with background and stuff
- changes colors when you interact with form fields

## stuff i used

- html5 for the form structure
- css3 for making it look nice (learned grid layout for this)
- a bit of javascript for basic interactions

## things i added myself

honestly most of the styling is mine. the tutorial just showed the basic html and css form, but i wanted it to look more professional so i:
- made it responsive with css grids
- added gradient (the 2 colors slipt in halfs) backgrounds (took forever to get right)
- wrote some javascript for form feedback
- made it work properly on phones

## try it out

just download the files and open index.html in your browser. fill out the form and see what happens.

## files

- job.html (the main page)
- styles.css (all my styling)  
- script.js (basic javascript stuff)
